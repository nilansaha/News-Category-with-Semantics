# News-Category-with-Semantics

Supervised Learning although is really efficient has the same pipeline most of the time. For a change I wanted to see how far we could go using just
semantics in terms of embeddings and unsupervised similarity metrics to classify categories of the newsgroup dataset.

Disclaimer - Framing this as a supervised problem would yield much better results

Performance results for different `k` values
